## Connecting Transit Options in San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties
The Vamos Mobility travel options smartphone application connects San Joaquin Valley residents with affordable and clean ways to get you where you want to go. Vamos Mobility currently lets you plan trips in San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties, and will soon be available more widely in the Valley. The app is free, and available now for iOS and Android devices.

## How It Works
Customers with a smartphone can use the app to plan trips within and between San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties. The app provides information and plans routes across all transit agencies in the two counties, including trips across multiple agencies and services, covering both Ô¨Åxed-route transit trips and connections to dial-a-ride services. In later phases, the app will include the ability to make trip reservations, buy tickets, and access other transportation services. 

Vamos Mobility is part of the Valley Flex/Valley Go project, an ecosystem of new rural transportation options being developed in the San Joaquin Valley. The project was made possible by a [California Air Resources Board](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/california-climate-investments) grant putting cap-and-trade dollars to work in the state, as well as contributions by local project partners.
